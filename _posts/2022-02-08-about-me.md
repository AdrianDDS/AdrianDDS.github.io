## Hola!

 Hi! I'm Adri, a spanish mathematician, programmer and, most important, a passionate about videogames. I've loved this media since I was 8 and my parents gifted me with a GameBoy Color and a copy of Pokemon Gold. Looking back this title along with others like Final Fantasy Tactics, Golden Sun, Fire Emblem, Guild Wars, Hearthstone.. (the list goes on) were the source of inspiration for the career in videogames that I want to achieve.

But then I grow up and didn't really have any idea of what to do with my live. I didn't have any coding abilities neither really considered working in the industry so I studied Mathematics. It really wasn't a hard choice: I was good at maths, liked riddles and problem solving, and essentially enjoyed understanding the mechanism of things.. so it seemed very straight forward to me :)

By the time I ended my studies, I started working as a data scientist in consultancy. It wasnt my dream job, but I made good friends and discovered the resemblances between coding and doing maths. At least, since the pov of understanding the behavior of abstract structures and find how to use them to solve different problematics. So after 5 years working in data science I finally decided to quit and resume my studies, now pointing towards using both maths and coding for finding a place in the game industry.

## Last year

This brings us to the point where I found the [master of game programming at U-Tad](https://u-tad.com/en/studies/masters-degree-in-video-game-programming/), and it seemed exactly what I was looking for. I met some of the most talented people I've ever known and learned about the core of the game programming. During the year my partners and I developed some demos (most of them at jam speed :') ) and even Ronin-Hood Sisters; an actual game that served as the final project for the 18 member team (among programmers, artist and designers) that parcipated in the development.

## Right Now

It's been a really intense year, full of emotions, hardwork and satisfaction. I really hope it can help me finding a place in this, my beloved game industry, but, even if it doesn't I think that it will be worth.

I pretend to use this site to show my projects and analyze different techniques that took my eye. Probably it will touch different topics, but right now I'm most interested in the fields of programming and tech art that have a deeper mathematical background (for obvious reasons). 

Thanks for reading me, hope you like it!
